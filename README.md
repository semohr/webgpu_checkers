# Checkers WebGPU Demo

A simple checkers game using WebGpu with star trek theming.
It was mainly created to explore the new (2023) WebGpu API and not to create a fully functional game, especially user input is not very polished.

Feel free to have a look at the code and use it as a starting point for your own WebGpu projects.

WEBGPU IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL BROWSERS. THIS DEMO WILL ONLY WORK WITH WEBGPU ENABLED. SEE [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API#browser_compatibility) FOR COMPATIBILITY.

I have put a demo online here (TODO)

## Run

You can run it locally by cloning the repo and running `npm install` and `npm run dev`. This will start a local server on port 4000.
